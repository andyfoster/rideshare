A simple CRUD Rails app for listing rides and contacting other members.

This could be used for any kind of community noticeboard and I will make an extensible framework for this in the future.


[This is ](https://github.com/andyfoster/rideshare/ "Hokkaido Rideshare") a mockup of what the app looks like with data.
